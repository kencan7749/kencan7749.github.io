# Work experience
- Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC2)
  
  Research title "Developing movie reconstruction from human brain activity"
  
  time: April 2022 - March 2024
  
  I aim to develop a movie reconstruction algorithm from human fMRI activity.
  I designed data collection, developing several movie reconstruction algorithms and evaluation metrics.
  I presented the results at various symposiums or oral presentations in Japan.

  
- Research intern

  Research title "Toword building multi-modal voice conversion model" supported by Dr. Kameoka at  NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan

  time: August 2018 - September 2018 

  I worked on developing voice conversion methods. 
  I tried to convert speech into a voice that matches an input face image and generates a face image that matches the voice of the input speech by Deep neural network. 
  My work was just preliminary, but this project was submitted to arXiv ("Crossmodal Voice Conversion" https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04540)


- [pytorch_cnn_preferred](https://github.com/kencan7749/pytorch_cnn_preferred)
  A pytorch tool for generating image/video in which a target unit/channel's activation is high was developed in my master period.

- Intern job
  I worked on New business planning at Works Applications Co., Ltd., during summer vacation.
