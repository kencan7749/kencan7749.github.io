# Work experience
- Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (JSPS DC2)
  - Research title: "Developing movie reconstruction from human brain activity"
  - Period: April 2022 - March 2024
  - Description: I aim to develop a movie reconstruction algorithm from human fMRI activity. I designed data collection, developing several movie reconstruction algorithms and evaluation metrics. I presented the results at various symposiums or oral presentations in Japan.

  
- Research intern
  - Research title: "Toward building multi-modal voice conversion model" supported by Dr. Kameoka at  NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan
  - Period: August 2018 - September 2018 
  - Description: I worked on developing voice conversion methods. I tried to convert speech into a voice that matches an input face image and generates a face image that matches the voice of the input speech by a Deep neural network. My work was just preliminary, but this project was submitted to arXiv ("Crossmodal Voice Conversion" https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04540)

- Misc
  - [pytorch_cnn_preferred](https://github.com/kencan7749/pytorch_cnn_preferred)
    - Year: 2018
    - A pytorch tool for generating image/video in which a target unit/channel's activation is high was developed in my master period.

  - Intern job
    - Year: 2016
    - Description: I worked on New business planning at Works Applications Co., Ltd., during summer vacation.

# ArtWork

- [MisakiB]
  - I supported the building of the digital clone of Misaki Abe, a student at Tokyo University of the Arts, by ChatGPT, Whisper, and lipsync model. This artwork was used for her graduation works.

- [Artwork using AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8B77w6wPa8&t=157s)
  - We created the video generated by having AI (StyleGAN-XL +CLIP) recognize the poem.
  - We got an **honorable mention award** at The 1st AI Art Grand Prix (March 2023) and collaborated with my colleague.
